2021/02/27 11:17:19 PM MST,I consent,"I believe that we should have a free universal healthcare system, not just a universal health insurance. I would advocate for a completely parallel system funded by the federal government with its own doctors, nurses and hospitals. Every person should have a right to use it. Of course, I would not ban private healthcare too. People should have a choice whether to go to a government hospital or doctor or a private one. Private system should not be subsidized by any government money.","I really like a pineapple and ham pizza, so I am definitely for it.",Positive,Positive
2021/03/01 1:09:18 PM MST,I consent,"I believe universal health care would not only provide better health care for everyone, but it would also reduce costs considerably. The cost reduction is already proven to be the case in several other countries. One disadvantage might be long wait times for treatment until the system is expanded enough to accommodate the increase of people seeking health care because it is more affordable. A greater percentage of people being treated would not only increase health benefits, it would also help prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19.","Since I do like pineapple and it goes well with things like sausage and pepperoni, I like it as an option on pizza; however, since pizza without it also tastes good, pineapple is not a requirement for pizza in my case. I would like pineapple on pizza even more if it could somehow be used to reduce the amount of salt found in pizza.",Positive,Positive

On some pizzas I could understand, sometimes you need an element of sweetness to balance out the savoriness or to enrich umami, but the pineapple has to be prepared correctly, you can’t just throw it on the pizza and let it bake and get all soggy.

It also shouldn't disrupt the ability of private companies to to engage in philanthropy across the world; if drug companies begin raising prices in order to start breaking even in the developing world and global access to drugs decreases, that would be a detriment, albeit not domestically.

2021/03/04 8:26:44 AM MST,I consent,Healthcare becoming paid and sponsored by the government is a good idea but many who have self inflected injuries or issues would be using a majority of the funds provided by the government and specifically for Albuquerque we have a massive drug problem and the entire country is experiencing an obesity epidemic and all of the effort using to treat them would be using the majority of the funds for a minority of the population. It would be a great accomplishment if we could have more universal health care but unnecessary and avoidable treatments across the country should be reduced first before implementing a more federal supported health care. I don't know much about healthcare costs but I know that living a healthy lifestyle will save you money in the future and if everyone lived a healthy lifestyle a universal health care system would go more to the ones who need it like genetic diseases and other health emergencies out of their control.

That doesn't seem too universal to me.  This is why people buy their OWN health insurance, not free insurance and wasting other people's hard earned tax payer dollars so all of these homeless people can buy more useless drugs for themselves.","Pineapple pizza is good if the chunks aren't too big, and their is an even amount of pepperoni on the pizza to balance the flavors.

2021/03/04 10:53:38 AM MST,I consent,"I think that expanding federally implemented universal health care has different advantages and disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages are that healthy people end up indirectly paying for the healthcare of the people who are not healthy. Another disadvantage is that because people are not paying for or are paying less for their own healthcare, there is no financial incentive to stay healthy which leads to longer wait times and doctors being overwhelmed with patients. Also, because of costs, the government might limit some of the services that are offered to patients. Overall I think that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages for expanding of federally implemented universal healthcare. I do think however, that there should be some support for people who are in need of financial help in that area.","I think that pineapple does not belong on pizza. Pineapple is an acidic food, so is tomato sauce, this brings an imbalance to the pizza. Also, pineapple ruins the whole pizza, if you pick the pineapple off of a slice it will still have the lingering taste of the pineapple juice. I think that separately, pineapple and pizza are both great but they should not be mixed together because then both are ruined.",Negative,Negative

2021/03/04 12:00:12 PM MST,I consent,"I think expanding federally implemented universal health care should be definitely allowed, especially in areas that are underdeveloped. The health care in America is already overpriced without insurance, and those living in poorer areas always suffer from health issues that eventually get passed onto their children with no aide to live with it. Universally, this can be applied as well. For example: a lot of people put off going to the doctor's in fear of finding out something medically malignant they have, and the costs. While some other people don't have that luxury. Now the free healthcare that is given to the poor supposedly take weeks to actually have a scheduled appointment ready. Overall, there's just a big problem that those with access don't use it fully as it is meant to be, and those who don't have that luxury are never given the option to see a doctor/specialist when needed.","Personally I dislike pizza in general because it is already quite unhealthy, as considering this is America; the land of freedom to cultivate bad habits, which nourishes an unproductive behavior. I consider to be a special individual who surpasses even the great Gordon Ramsay himself, in terms of distinguishing which is a dignified dish. My palate is far superior than any plebeian on this Earth--for I find fruits sour, and lemons to be sweet as pure sugar. With that reference, obviously pineapple is already quite sour that other serfs have noted for me, but it is a horrible bitter, sweet, and sour mixture all together that completely destroys savory taste of tomato sauce that complements the flavor of cheese. Now pause there; the latter I mentioned of what pizza usually tastes like is only when you take the first bite on a plain cheese pizza. There are other variables to consider like toppings that people contemplate to be pleasing to their brutish primitive taste-buds for wanting something more ""sophisticated"" from their dull hours of work. Take the capitalist pigs who you often find the grease of greed that fill their minds of ecstasy; thus liking more fatty toppings like pepperoni or sausage with a smooth lining of gold paper to look more refined than a commoner. So because we are talking about pineapple pizza, and not specifically Hawaiian pizza, we will assume that this is a pineapple pizza only topping since no other adjectives modify the subject. Hawaiian pizza includes meat to combat the flavor of pineapple so it isn't overpowering the natural essence of pizza. So, due to this being pineapple-only pizza, the pineapple completely ruins the true flavor of pizza. We also have to take into consideration the kind of company that makes the pizza, where the pineapple comes from (is it truly from South America), the cheese that is used, and temperature--is the pineapple also cooked or raw? From that we can clearly make a deduction that pineapple pizza, anywhere, fails to uphold the flavor standards where beggars decide to be choosers. There will be bound to be pizza places that cannot make a harmony of flavor between pineapple on pizza, and certainly not decide to experiment with different cheese and cooking temperatures to bring out a more bold smoked sweet flavor that pineapples can have (ex. bbq pineapple). If you decide that you do like pineapple pizza, then you are confirming that your primitive taste-buds cannot withstand the true flavors of the world. No wonder Gordon Ramsay's lamb sauce vaporized with your raw energy of ignorance you developed by actually encouraging your bad habits of deciding to eat pineapple on pizza. That pineapple pizza belongs back in the ground of where the pineapple once grew to restart its life from the shame it has for being put on pizza. ",Positive,Negative
